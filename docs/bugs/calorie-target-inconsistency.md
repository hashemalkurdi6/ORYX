# Calorie target inconsistency between survey and Nutrition tab

**Status:** Investigation only — no code changes proposed yet. Awaiting approval before fix.

## Root cause

There is **no single source of truth** for the user's daily calorie target. Four problems compound:

1. **The mobile app computes TDEE during signup with a different formula than the backend.** Signup posts the result to the backend, which stores it verbatim. The backend's own formula is only run later (lazily, on first read of `/nutrition/targets` or `/nutrition/today`), and it produces a *different* number — which silently overwrites the User row.
2. **There are two storage locations** for the same value: `users.daily_calorie_target` and `nutrition_targets.daily_calorie_target`. They are not always in sync.
3. **Different endpoints read from different storage locations**, so what the user sees on Home, Nutrition, and the AI prompts can diverge.
4. **The survey edit endpoint (`PATCH /nutrition/profile`) does not recompute or invalidate `nutrition_targets`.** Changing diet type, carb approach, or sugar preference is silently ignored by the calorie target. Same for `PATCH /me/onboarding` and `PATCH /me/profile` even when `weight_kg`, `height_cm`, `age`, `weekly_training_days`, or `primary_goal` change.

This is a combination of the two patterns the prompt asked about: **"two different storage locations holding the same target"** + **"a cached value that's gone stale and isn't being invalidated when the survey is updated"** + **"frontend computing a target locally instead of reading it from backend"**.

## Calculation sites

The formula is implemented **three times**, with **divergent rules**:

### 1. Backend — [armen/backend/app/services/nutrition_service.py](../../armen/backend/app/services/nutrition_service.py)

- `calculate_macro_targets(user_id, db)` (line 18) is the function the spec describes.
- `_compute_tdee(user)` (line 385) — Mifflin-St Jeor BMR × activity multiplier × **multiplicative goal adjustment** (`fat/loss/cut/lean` ×0.85, `muscle/build/bulk/gain/mass` ×1.10, `perform/athlete/sport/endurance` ×1.05, else ×1.0).
- Activity multiplier is parsed loosely from `weekly_training_days` string (`"every day"` → 1.9, `"5"`/`"6"` → 1.725, `"3"`/`"4"` → 1.55, else 1.375).
- **Side-effects**: mutates `user.daily_calorie_target` AND upserts a row in `nutrition_targets`. Both are written.

### 2. Mobile — [armen/mobile/app/(auth)/signup.tsx:119-124](../../armen/mobile/app/(auth)/signup.tsx#L119-L124)

```ts
function calcTDEE(wKg, hCm, age, sex, days, goalAdj) {
  const bonus = sex === 'Male' ? 5 : sex === 'Female' ? -161 : -78;
  const bmr = Math.round(10 * wKg + 6.25 * hCm - 5 * age + bonus);
  const mult = ACTIVITY_MULT[days] ?? 1.55;
  return { bmr, tdee: Math.round(bmr * mult + goalAdj), multiplier: mult, goalAdj };
}
```

- **Additive goal adjustment in kcal** (lines 96–106): Build Muscle +200, Improve Endurance +100, Compete in a Sport +150, fat-loss rates −200/−400/−600.
- Activity multiplier keyed on the *exact UI label* (`'1 to 2 days'`, `'3 to 4 days'`, etc.).
- **The result is sent to `POST /auth/signup` as `daily_calorie_target`** (line 275). Backend writes it directly to `users.daily_calorie_target` without re-validation ([auth.py:168](../../armen/backend/app/routers/auth.py#L168)).

**Numerical example.** A 75 kg, 175 cm, 30 yo male, training 5–6 days/week, "Build Muscle":

| | Mobile | Backend |
|---|---|---|
| BMR | 1699 | 1698.75 |
| × activity | × 1.725 = 2930 | × 1.725 = 2930 |
| Goal adj | + 200 | × 1.10 = 3223 |
| **TDEE** | **3130 kcal** | **3223 kcal** |

The user sees 3130 kcal during signup. The first time anything calls `/nutrition/today` or `/nutrition/targets`, the backend silently overwrites the User row with 3223 kcal. The Nutrition tab shows 3223. Different number, no notification.

### 3. Backend (vestigial fallback) — [armen/backend/app/routers/home.py:48-64](../../armen/backend/app/routers/home.py#L48-L64)

`_compute_macro_targets(calorie_target, primary_goal)` does a hardcoded percentage split (P/C/F by goal). Only used as a fallback when `nutrition_targets` row doesn't exist yet, but it's a third copy of similar logic and deserves removal.

## Storage sites

Two separate columns hold the same value:

| Location | Set by |
|---|---|
| `users.daily_calorie_target` ([model](../../armen/backend/app/models/user.py#L60)) | `POST /auth/signup` (mobile-computed value), `PATCH /me/onboarding`, `calculate_macro_targets` (overwrites) |
| `nutrition_targets.daily_calorie_target` ([model](../../armen/backend/app/models/nutrition_targets.py#L22)) | `calculate_macro_targets` only |

There is no DB constraint or trigger keeping them in sync.

## Read sites

Every place the calorie target is read, with the exact field path:

### Backend → mobile

| Endpoint | Reads from | File |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /home/dashboard` → `dashboard.calorie_target` | `current_user.daily_calorie_target` | [home.py:290](../../armen/backend/app/routers/home.py#L290), [home.py:665](../../armen/backend/app/routers/home.py#L665) |
| `GET /home/dashboard` → `dashboard.macro_targets` | `nutrition_targets` (via `get_cached_targets`) with `_compute_macro_targets` fallback | [home.py:295-304](../../armen/backend/app/routers/home.py#L295-L304) |
| `GET /nutrition/today` → `targets.daily_calorie_target` | `nutrition_targets` (via `get_cached_targets`) — returns `null` if no row | [nutrition.py:140](../../armen/backend/app/routers/nutrition.py#L140) |
| `GET /nutrition/targets` | `nutrition_targets`; if null, calls `calculate_macro_targets` (which mutates User row + creates row) | [nutrition.py:204-208](../../armen/backend/app/routers/nutrition.py#L204-L208) |
| `POST /nutrition/targets/recalculate` | always recomputes via `calculate_macro_targets` | [nutrition.py:254-261](../../armen/backend/app/routers/nutrition.py#L254-L261) |
| `GET /nutrition/weekly-summary` | `current_user.daily_calorie_target or 2000` | [nutrition.py:484](../../armen/backend/app/routers/nutrition.py#L484) |
| `GET /nutrition/weekly-calories` | `nutrition_targets.daily_calorie_target` → `current_user.daily_calorie_target` → 2000 | [nutrition.py:528-531](../../armen/backend/app/routers/nutrition.py#L528-L531) |
| `POST /nutrition/meal-plan/regenerate` (AI prompt) | `get_cached_targets` → `calculate_macro_targets` (creates if missing) → `user.daily_calorie_target` fallback | [meal_plan.py:124](../../armen/backend/app/routers/meal_plan.py#L124), [meal_plan.py:800-803](../../armen/backend/app/routers/meal_plan.py#L800-L803) |
| `POST /nutrition/assistant` (AI prompt context) | same as meal-plan/regenerate | [meal_plan.py:858](../../armen/backend/app/routers/meal_plan.py#L858) |
| `POST /posts/...` (Daily Insight Card stat capture) | `nutrition_targets.daily_calorie_target` → `current_user.daily_calorie_target` | [posts.py:475-487](../../armen/backend/app/routers/posts.py#L475-L487) |
| `readiness_service` (recovery context) | `user.daily_calorie_target` | [readiness_service.py:347](../../armen/backend/app/services/readiness_service.py#L347) |

### Mobile screens

| Screen | Field | File |
|---|---|---|
| Home — Nutrition snapshot card | `dashboard.calorie_target` (from `users.daily_calorie_target`) | [(tabs)/index.tsx:662](../../armen/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx#L662) |
| Nutrition tab — calorie circle | `targets.daily_calorie_target` (from `nutrition_targets`); `?? 2000` | [(tabs)/nutrition.tsx:967](../../armen/mobile/app/(tabs)/nutrition.tsx#L967) |
| Nutrition tab — weekly bar chart targets | per-day `target` from `/nutrition/weekly-calories` | [(tabs)/nutrition.tsx:373](../../armen/mobile/app/(tabs)/nutrition.tsx#L373) |
| Daily check-in pre-log card | `dashboard.calorie_target` (passed through from Home) | [checkin.tsx:98](../../armen/mobile/app/checkin.tsx#L98) |

**The smoking gun**: the Home card and the Nutrition card read from different DB columns. Whenever those two columns disagree (which they will — see below), the user sees two different numbers for the same metric.

## How the inconsistency presents in practice

### Scenario A — fresh signup, before opening Nutrition tab

1. User completes signup. Mobile computes TDEE = 3130 (additive goal adj). Sends to backend.
2. Backend stores `users.daily_calorie_target = 3130`. `nutrition_targets` row does not exist yet.
3. User lands on Home. `GET /home/dashboard` returns `calorie_target = 3130`. **Home card: 3130 ✓**
4. User opens Nutrition tab. `GET /nutrition/today` returns `targets = null` (no `nutrition_targets` row). The mobile then reads `?? 2000` and shows 2000. **Nutrition card: 2000 ✗** (concretely wrong; mismatch with Home).
5. In parallel, mobile calls `getNutritionTargets()` (`/nutrition/targets`). That endpoint creates the row by calling `calculate_macro_targets`, which **also** mutates the User row to 3223 (backend formula). Now `users.daily_calorie_target = 3223` and `nutrition_targets.daily_calorie_target = 3223`. Mobile updates `targets` state. **Nutrition card: 3223** — but Home is still showing the cached 3130 from the earlier dashboard fetch.
6. User pulls to refresh on Home. Now Home returns 3223. They went from 3130 → 3223 with no explanation.

### Scenario B — user edits the survey to change goal/diet

1. Existing user. `users.daily_calorie_target` and `nutrition_targets.daily_calorie_target` both equal 3223 (synced earlier).
2. User edits the nutrition survey. Changes `diet_type` to "Vegan", `carb_approach` to "Low carb", `sugar_preference` to "Avoid".
3. Mobile sends `PATCH /nutrition/profile` (which is `meal_plan.py:upsert_nutrition_profile`). It saves the profile fields and **does not recompute targets**.
4. The Nutrition tab still shows 3223 cal / old protein / old carb / old fat split. The user expected the new diet to influence at least the protein and macro split.
5. The meal plan generator on next regenerate uses `get_cached_targets` which returns the *stale* row. The diet change is silently ignored by the calorie/macro math even though the AI prompt does see the updated profile fields.

### Scenario C — user changes goal via `PATCH /me/onboarding`

1. User changes `primary_goal` from "General Fitness" to "Lose Weight" via settings.
2. `update_onboarding` writes the new goal but does **not** recompute targets.
3. `users.daily_calorie_target` stays at maintenance (2930). `nutrition_targets` row stays at maintenance.
4. Home and Nutrition both still show maintenance, but the survey screen and assistant prompt show the new goal. Inconsistent state.

## Proposed single source of truth

A single source: **`nutrition_targets`**, populated by exactly one function: **`calculate_macro_targets`**, in [armen/backend/app/services/nutrition_service.py](../../armen/backend/app/services/nutrition_service.py).

The `users.daily_calorie_target` column becomes a **convenience denormalisation** that is **only ever written by `calculate_macro_targets`** alongside the `nutrition_targets` row. The `OnboardingUpdate` and `UserCreate` schemas should drop `daily_calorie_target` from their accepted input fields. Onboarding completion triggers `calculate_macro_targets` server-side.

**Trigger points** (everywhere the formula inputs can change):
- After `POST /auth/signup` if all required inputs (weight, height, age, sex, weekly_training_days, primary_goal) are present.
- After `PATCH /me/onboarding` whenever any of those fields was in the patch payload, OR when `onboarding_complete` flips to true.
- After `PATCH /nutrition/profile` whenever `diet_type`, `carb_approach`, `sugar_preference`, or `strictness_level` was in the payload (these affect protein/carb/fat splits and sugar/fibre/iron/calcium targets).
- After `PATCH /me/profile` (or wherever weight gets saved — see audit item 1.3 area) whenever `weight_kg` changes.

**Reads**:
- All endpoints that currently read from `users.daily_calorie_target` directly should be migrated to use `get_cached_targets`. If `get_cached_targets` returns null, call `calculate_macro_targets` once to populate.
- Drop the `_compute_macro_targets` fallback in `home.py` — once `nutrition_targets` is consistently populated, it is dead code.
- The mobile signup screen continues to *display* a preview during the multi-step flow (good UX — we want the user to see roughly what they're committing to), but **stops sending `daily_calorie_target` to the backend**. The preview becomes informational only. Backend computes the persisted value from the same inputs.

**Cache invalidation**: not really a cache — `nutrition_targets` is the persistent store. "Invalidation" simply means: any endpoint that mutates a formula input must end its handler by calling `calculate_macro_targets`. There is no separate cache layer to invalidate.

## Files that need to change (fix phase, awaiting approval)

### Backend

- [armen/backend/app/routers/auth.py](../../armen/backend/app/routers/auth.py) — `signup` and `update_onboarding`: stop accepting `daily_calorie_target` from the client; call `calculate_macro_targets` if all inputs present.
- [armen/backend/app/schemas/user.py](../../armen/backend/app/schemas/user.py) — drop `daily_calorie_target` from `UserCreate` and `OnboardingUpdate` input schemas. Keep it on the *output* schemas (`UserOut`/`UserOutInternal`) since reads are fine.
- [armen/backend/app/routers/meal_plan.py](../../armen/backend/app/routers/meal_plan.py) — `upsert_nutrition_profile`: at the end, call `calculate_macro_targets` if any formula-affecting field was in the payload (`diet_type`, `carb_approach`, `sugar_preference`, `strictness_level`).
- [armen/backend/app/routers/nutrition.py](../../armen/backend/app/routers/nutrition.py) — `weekly-summary` (line 484) and `weekly-calories` (lines 528–531): switch to `get_cached_targets`, lazy-create with `calculate_macro_targets` if missing. Stop reading from `current_user.daily_calorie_target`.
- [armen/backend/app/routers/home.py](../../armen/backend/app/routers/home.py) — read `daily_calorie_target` via `get_cached_targets` (with lazy create) instead of `current_user.daily_calorie_target`. Remove `_compute_macro_targets` once the fallback path is gone.
- [armen/backend/app/routers/posts.py](../../armen/backend/app/routers/posts.py) — same migration; drop the User-row fallback.
- [armen/backend/app/services/readiness_service.py](../../armen/backend/app/services/readiness_service.py) — same.
- [armen/backend/app/services/nutrition_service.py](../../armen/backend/app/services/nutrition_service.py) — small docstring update to mark itself as the only writer; otherwise unchanged.
- (Optional follow-up, not part of this fix) Add a DB trigger or a check in tests asserting the User column always equals the `nutrition_targets` column. Belt-and-braces.

### Mobile

- [armen/mobile/app/(auth)/signup.tsx](../../armen/mobile/app/(auth)/signup.tsx) — keep `calcTDEE` as a *display preview* during the calorie step. Stop sending `daily_calorie_target` to `POST /auth/signup`. After signup completes, call `getNutritionTargets()` once to populate, then surface the *backend-computed* value back to the user before they leave the flow (or accept that the value they see may differ on first Home load — but UX-wise we should match the displayed preview to the backend formula).
  - **Cleanest fix**: replace the additive `GOAL_ADJ` constants with multipliers identical to the backend (`fat/loss/cut/lean` ×0.85, `muscle/build/bulk/gain/mass` ×1.10, `perform/athlete/sport/endurance` ×1.05, else ×1.0). Then the preview matches the persisted value byte-for-byte and there's no surprise jump.
- [armen/mobile/app/nutrition-survey.tsx](../../armen/mobile/app/nutrition-survey.tsx) — after `PATCH /nutrition/profile` succeeds, refetch `/nutrition/targets` (or call `/nutrition/targets/recalculate` then refetch) so the in-memory state reflects the new targets. The backend is doing the recompute server-side; the mobile just needs to pull fresh data.
- [armen/mobile/app/(tabs)/nutrition.tsx](../../armen/mobile/app/(tabs)/nutrition.tsx) — no semantic change needed (already reads from `nutrition_targets`). Possibly remove the `?? 2000` fallback in favour of a loading state, since after the backend fix `targets` will always be populated for any user past onboarding.
- [armen/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx](../../armen/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx) — no change needed (already reads `dashboard.calorie_target`, which after the backend fix becomes the same value as the Nutrition tab reads).

### Migration / data fix

- One-shot migration script (`armen/backend/scripts/`) that, for every user with `onboarding_complete = true`, runs `calculate_macro_targets` to bring both columns into sync with the canonical formula. Existing users will see a one-time recalculation. We should expect a small number of users to see their calorie target shift; that's the explicit intent (correct value over historical mobile-computed value).

## Audit item interactions

- **Audit 1.3 (survey wipe)**: already fixed in the survey hydration code at [nutrition-survey.tsx:339-355](../../armen/mobile/app/nutrition-survey.tsx#L339-L355) — survey loads from `getNutritionProfile()` and merges, doesn't reset to `DEFAULT_SURVEY`. The proposed fix here does not regress it. **Flag only — not expanding scope**.
- **Audit 1.4 (timezone)**: orthogonal. The targets calc doesn't depend on day boundaries. **Flag only — not expanding scope**.

## Out of scope for this fix (deliberate)

- Re-architecting `nutrition_targets` to be the only column (drop the User-row column entirely). That's a bigger change touching many callers; doing the smaller "always go through `calculate_macro_targets`" fix achieves consistency without a schema migration.
- Apple HealthKit-driven recalculation (e.g., recompute when imported weight from HealthKit lands). The audit doesn't call for this and it would expand scope.
- Changing the formula itself. The Mifflin-St Jeor + multiplicative goal adjustment in `_compute_tdee` is what we standardise on.

---

**Decision needed from you**: approve the proposed single source of truth + file list above, then I'll execute the fix in three commits (backend fix → mobile fix → data-recalc migration script).
